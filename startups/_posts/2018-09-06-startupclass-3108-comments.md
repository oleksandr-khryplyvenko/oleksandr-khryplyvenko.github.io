Looking backwards to my life. Once better than never.

"The best people always seem to be building stuff and hanging around smart people, so if you have to decide between several options, this may be a good filter"<br>
<b>Hell yeah</b>

"Working on something good will pull you along a path where good things keep happening to you."<br>
<b>Totally confirm. This works for me since 2013 when I stopped working @ office</b>

"Spending a few years at a company that fails has path consequences, and working at an already-massively-successful company means you will learn much less, and probably work with less impressive people."<br>
<b>Hell yeah. @ huge companies time shrinks in ratio: You work N yrs for it -> you get only to 2 months during which your skills increase.</b>


"Incidentally, don’t let salary be a factor.  I just watched someone turn down one of these breakout companies because Microsoft offered him $30k per year more in salary—that was a terrible decision.  He will not build interesting things and may not work with smart people.  In a few years, when it’s time for something new, the options in front of him will be much worse than they could have been."<br>
<b>You're god damn right. I made this mistake.</b>

"If you start a company, only do so if you have an idea you’re in love with.  If you’re hanging out with your friends trying to come up with an idea, I don’t think you should start that company"<br>
If there were a polygraph test for СEOs... I wish it was. We wouldn't have lots of money gone to shitty 'another one' instead of 'breaking through'

"You believe you’re extremely talented and that this is the way to maximize your financial return on that talent. Why wouldn’t you want more of the cap table? This is flawed logic, since the 100th engineer at Facebook made far more money than 99% of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. Small slices of gigantic pies are still themselves gigantic. If you’re extremely talented, you can easily identify a company with high growth potential and relatively low risk and get an aggressive compensation package from them. If you turn out to be wrong after a few years, you can try again. Within 2 or 3 tries, and likely on the first one, you’ll have a great outcome and can be confident you contributed serious lasting value to the world. If you instead try to immediately start “the next Google or Facebook”, there is a very high likelihood that you will fail completely, or be forced to settle for a much smaller outcome. It will take a long time to reach success or failure, so you won’t have many tries"

<b>You have to be extremely talented</b><br>
<b>You don't have own ideas you're passionated with</b><br>

"One, don’t claim you’re changing the world until you’ve changed it."<br>
"Two, ignore the haters and work on whatever you find interesting"<br>
